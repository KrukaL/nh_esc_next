esc_tech_armor_hardening_lm_2: "Living Absorption Plating"
esc_tech_armor_hardening_lm_2_desc: "As we learn more about the living metals, new ways of utilizing its amazing properties open before us. Ones such as improved reactive armor plating for our ships and stations that can further reduce their suspectability to enemy fire."

esc_tech_shield_hardening_psi_2: "Shroud-Enhanced Shield Hardener"
esc_tech_shield_hardening_psi_2_desc: "By channelling additional psionic energies from the Shroud, we can further improve the hardness of our ships' shield and, maybe, make them stronger in general as well."

esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_kill_1: "Dead Hand Switch: Kill Command Protocols"
esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_kill_1_desc: "Development and implementation of ship self-destruct protocols will provide our fleets with one last desperation attack in the face of destruction. If we're willing to accept extra causalties it will create."
esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_kill_1_bio: "Catalytic Bladder Augmentation"
esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_kill_1_bio_desc: "By giving warbeasts under our command specialized sacks that would rupture and release highly-volatile substances upon creature's death we may be able to inflict some additional damage upon our enemies."

esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_kill_2: "Dead Hand Switch: Annihilate Command Protocols"
esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_kill_2_desc: "Despite the increase in space combat causalties the self-destruct protocols have created, the results can't be ignored. And thus, a new set of protocols that will enhance damage caused by ships' self-destruct should be developed and implemented."
esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_kill_2_bio: "Volatile Catalytic Bladder"
esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_kill_2_bio_desc: "Through further genetic engineering we can improve upon our original designs for catalytic bladders, giving them higher amounts of even more volatile substances. These bladders would explode upon creature's death, hopefully taking out a few enemy ships in the process."

esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_heal_1: "Dead Hand Switch: Repair Allies Command Protocols"
esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_heal_1_desc: "It is rather wasteful to let all of the onboard repair drones die with the ship. New protocols for their emergency transfer need to be implemented to enhance the survival of the fleet as a whole."
esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_heal_1_bio: "Restorative Enzymes Sacks"
esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_heal_1_bio_desc: "By engineering our warbeasts to carry sacks of restorative enzymes on their bodies we can enhance the survivability of our fleets as whole: when one of the creatures goes down, those nearby will receive a dose of enzymes to jump-start their regenration and heal their wounds."

esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_heal_2: "Dead Hand Switch: Support Allies Command Protocols"
esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_heal_2_desc: "The emergency onboard repair drones transfer protocols have been proven to be greatly-beneficial to our fleets, so their improvements need to be considered."
esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_heal_2_bio: "Supreme Restorative Enzymes Sacks"
esc_tech_dead_hand_switch_heal_2_bio_desc: "By increasing the potency of resotrative enzymes carried by our warbeasts beyond the original template we can further improve the survivability of our fleets."
